### Introduction

The purpose of version control is to allow software teams track changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration between team members. Version control facilitates a continuous, simple way to develop software.

### Benefits of version control
1. Quality
Teams can review, comment, and improve each otherâ€™s code and assets.

2. Acceleration
Branch code, make changes, and merge commits faster.

3. Visibility
Understand and spark team collaboration to foster greater release build and release patterns.

### The best version control software are...

1. GitHub and GitLab
GitHub and GitLab, are the most popular option and have become synonymous with "source code management." GiGitHub and GitLab, are open source distributed system that are used for software projects of any size, making it a popular option for startups, enterprise, and everything in between.

2. Subversion
SVN is a widely adopted centralized version control system. This system keeps all of a project's files on a single codeline making it impossible to branch, so it's easy to scale for large projects. It's simple to learn and features folder security measures, so access to subfolders can be restricted.

2. Mercurial
Mercurial is a distributed version control system that offers simple branching and merging capabilities. The system enables rapid scaling and collaborative development, with an intuitive interface. The flexible command line interface enables users to begin using the system immediately.

### Version control streamlines collaboration.
Version control coordinates all changes in a software project, effectively tracking changes to source files, designs, and all digital assets required for a project and related metadata. Projects without version control and collaboration can easily become a tangled mess of different versions of project files, hindering the ability of any software development team to deliver value. With a strong version control solution, software teams can quickly assemble all critical project files and foster actionable communication to improve code quality. Stakeholders from across a DevOps team can collaborate to build innovative solutions - from product managers and designers to developers and operations professionals.
